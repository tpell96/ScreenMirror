1. Update Screen GUI - Better view 
2. Select Screen Area is not working properly. Think it has something to do with native/scaled resolution differences
3. Beautify the Source/Destination screen selectors
4. Add Broadcast Method - This would create a bounding box that is 16:9. 
    Anything in this area would be mirrored. 
    Kinda like a magnifying glass. 
    Would be nice if bounding box was floating / drag and drop
